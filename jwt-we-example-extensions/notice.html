		<h3>Usage Of Content</h3>

		<p>THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION 
		AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS
   		(COLLECTIVELY &quot;CONTENT&quot;).  USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE 
   		TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND
   		CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW.  
   		BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE
   		OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND 
   		CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR
   		NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS 
   		AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND
   		CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR 
   		REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.</p>
   
		<h3>Applicable Licenses</h3>   
   
		<p>Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation is 
		provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0
   		(&quot;EPL&quot;).  A copy of the EPL is provided with this Content and is also 
   		available at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html</a>.
   		For purposes of the EPL, &quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.</p>

		<p>Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code, documentation and 
		other files maintained in the Eclipse.org CVS repository (&quot;Repository&quot;) in CVS
   		modules (&quot;Modules&quot;) and made available as downloadable archives (&quot;Downloads&quot;).</p>
   
		<ul>
			<li>Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate delivering, extending, 
			and upgrading the Content.  Typical modules may include plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;), 
			plug-in fragments (&quot;Fragments&quot;), and features (&quot;Features&quot;).</li>
			<li>Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java&trade; ARchive) 
			in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;.</li>
			<li>A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material.  
			Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a directory named &quot;features&quot;.  
			Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and 
			version numbers of the Plug-ins
      		and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.</li>
			<li>Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;). Within a 
			Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version 
			numbers of Included Features.</li>
		</ul>   
 
		<p>The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in files 
		named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms and conditions governing Features and
		Included Features should be contained in files named &quot;license.html&quot; (
		&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;).  Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of 
		a Download or Module
		including, but not limited to the following locations:</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>The top-level (root) directory</li>
			<li>Plug-in and Fragment directories</li>
			<li>Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs</li>
			<li>Sub-directories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of certain Plug-ins</li>
			<li>Feature directories</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the Eclipse 
		Update Manager, you must agree to a license (&quot;Feature Update License&quot;) during the
		installation process.  If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License 
		should either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or
		inform you where you can locate them.  Feature Update Licenses may be found in the 
		&quot;license&quot; property of files named &quot;feature.properties&quot; found within a Feature.
		Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions 
		(or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the associated Content in
		that directory.</p>

		<p>THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO THE EPL OR OTHER 
		LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  SOME OF THESE
		OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):</p>
